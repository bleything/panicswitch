{"name":"Panic Switch","tagline":"Control your Hue lights from Status Board","body":"Ever thought to yourself \"dang, I wish I could control my light bulbs from\r\nPanic's Status Board app\"? Good news! Panic Switch is a widget for Panic's\r\n[Status Board] app that controls your [Philips Hue] lights.\r\n\r\n[Status Board]: https://panic.com/statusboard/\r\n[Philips Hue]: https://meethue.com\r\n\r\n### How Do?\r\n\r\nFirst we need to create the Panic Switch user on your Hue bridge. This is a\r\none-time operation that will not need to be repeated unless you replace or\r\nfactory reset your bridge.\r\n\r\n* Go to http://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp and note the IP address of your bridge\r\n* Go to http://BRIDGE_IP/debug/clip.html\r\n* Use the CLIP interface to `POST` the following JSON to `/api`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"devicetype\": \"Panic Switch\", \"username\": \"panicswitch\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* You should see an error saying `link button not pressed`. Push the link button\r\n  on your bridge and submit the `POST` again. You should see a success message.\r\n\r\nNext, set up Status Board. Add a Do-It-Yourself widget and set the Panel URL to\r\nhttp://bleything.github.io/panicswitch/widget.html\r\n\r\nAll done!\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 [Ben Bleything](mailto:ben@bleything.net)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
